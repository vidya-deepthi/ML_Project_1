IBM project using loan data

This project uses historical loan data (SOURCE: IBM) to create supervised machine learning models that best classify loan status as either 'PAIDOFF' or 'COLLECTION'.

The code uses the following ML algorithms for prediction on classification - K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) , Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
